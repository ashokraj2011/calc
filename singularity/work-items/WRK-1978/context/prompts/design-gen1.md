Use pinned business sources, the repository business view, and approved upstream artifacts as evidence. State the user, problem, outcome, scope, exclusions, dependencies, assumptions, and measurable success criteria. Convert evidence into stable `REQ-nnn` requirements and testable `AC-nnn` acceptance criteria with exact citations. Separate confirmed needs, proposals, and unresolved questions. Do not invent business intent or grant approval.

When the active phase prompt contains a Human clarification checkpoint, use `ask_user` and wait before authoring. A required checkpoint always pauses; if the evidence appears complete, ask the contributor to confirm the interpreted outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria. Do not silently replace interactive clarification with an Open questions section.

## Summary {#core.brief}

This repository is a React + Vite calculator web app with a single-page shell in `src/App.jsx` and a shared UI system in `src/components/` and `src/index.css`. The product exposes standard arithmetic, scientific functions, unit conversion, financial calculators, and a grapher mode through one client-side experience.

The main entry point is `src/main.jsx`, which mounts the app into the browser. The most important implementation module is `src/utils/evaluator.js`, which sanitizes expressions and routes calculations through `mathjs`. The default visual style is already a classic desk-calculator look, driven by CSS variables in `src/index.css`.

The standard validation command is `npm run build`; the app also has `npm run lint`, though lint currently reports many pre-existing issues in the source tree. The largest risk is that UI styling and calculator logic are spread across multiple components, so a small visual change can have broad effects. The working tree is not clean because tracked workflow artifacts have been deleted.

## TL;DR {#arch.tldr}

The app is a single-page React front end with a thin state shell and many presentational modules. The most important architectural boundary is the split between `src/App.jsx` (state and behavior), `src/components/` (views/panels), and `src/utils/evaluator.js` (numeric logic). The design is simple and cohesive, but visual and interaction changes touch several components because the styling layer is shared.

## Facts {#arch.facts}

```yaml
components: [calculator-shell, calculator-ui, calculator-engine, calculator-theme]
entrypoints:
  - { id: entry-main, path: src/main.jsx, line: 1, invocation: "ReactDOM createRoot" }
key_symbols:
  - { name: App, path: src/App.jsx, line: 14, role: "central state and mode router" }
  - { name: evaluateExpression, path: src/utils/evaluator.js, line: 4, role: "expression evaluation wrapper" }
commands:
  - { command: "npm run build", purpose: "production build", source: "package.json:6-10" }
hotspots:
  - { path: src/App.jsx, reason: "contains the largest state surface and shared handlers" }
```

## System context {#arch.context}

The repository is a front-end-only application. It has no backend service, database, or API layer. The runtime is a browser page served by Vite, and the main app state lives in memory and in browser storage. That makes the system easy to reason about, but it also means all logic is executed client-side.

## Component responsibilities {#arch.components}

- `src/App.jsx` is the orchestration layer. It manages expression/result/history/theme/sound state, keyboard shortcuts, and mode selection. It also routes to the standard, scientific, converter, financial, and grapher views.
- `src/components/` hosts the concrete views. `Display` renders the expression/result area, the keypads render calculator interactions, `FinancialCalculator` and `FunctionGrapher` provide specialized panels, and `Header` provides navigation and settings.
- `src/utils/evaluator.js` isolates arithmetic and financial logic. Its helpers are used by the UI layer and keep numeric formatting and calculation behavior out of the React components.
- `src/index.css` provides the shared design tokens and theme variants for the entire app.

## Dependency graph {#arch.graph}

The app shell depends on UI components and the evaluator. The UI components depend on the theme tokens and shared audio helper. The financial and grapher modules depend on the evaluator helpers rather than on one another. There is no service boundary or cross-module API beyond the React props passed between component layers.

## Interfaces and contracts {#arch.contracts}

The main contract is the prop-based interface between `App` and its child components. Key examples are the keypad props such as `onDigit`, `onOperator`, `onEquals`, and `onMemory`, and the display props such as `expression`, `result`, and `setAngleUnit`. These interfaces are lightweight and simple, but they are the main mechanism for state flow.

## Data ownership {#arch.data}

Expression state, calculation history, and user preference state are owned by `App` and persisted via `localStorage` in the browser. The evaluator module consumes expressions but does not own UI state. The financial and grapher panels hold their own local form state, which is derived from the evaluator outputs.

## Security and trust boundaries {#arch.security}

The main trust boundary is between browser-side user input and the evaluator. The app sanitizes expressions before evaluation, but the runtime still executes math expressions in the client. No secrets, authentication, or external backend trust boundary exists. The browser storage layer is a local persistence boundary only.

## Architectural risks {#arch.risks}

- The app shell is a large hub for state and UI orchestration; future features may increase its complexity.
- The visual design is spread across shared CSS variables and multiple component classes, so style regressions can be hard to isolate.
- The absence of an API layer means the architecture is intentionally simple, but it limits composability for more advanced workflows.

## Where to start {#arch.start}

Start with `src/App.jsx` for state flow, `src/utils/evaluator.js` for numeric behavior, and `src/index.css` for visual implementation.

## Questions this view does not answer {#arch.limits}

This view does not cover business requirements, release process, or detailed test coverage. It also does not attempt to document every component in the tree.

## Security summary {#sec.brief}

This view is for security review and trust-boundary analysis. The app is browser-only and does not implement authentication, authorization, or server-side secrets. The main sensitive surface is the calculator evaluator in `src/utils/evaluator.js`, which processes user-entered expressions client-side, and the browser storage logic in `src/App.jsx`.

The most common mistake is assuming the app has a backend security model when it does not. The repository has no secrets and no authentication flow, but it still needs careful review around expression sanitization and browser persistence. The best starting points are `src/utils/evaluator.js` and `src/App.jsx`.

## TL;DR {#task.classic-calculator-look.tldr}

The task is to change the look of the calculator to match a classic calculator. The relevant implementation points are the shared theme tokens in `src/index.css`, the header/display/keypad components in `src/components/`, and the shell state in `src/App.jsx`. The safest approach is to adjust the shared theme variables first and then verify that the main calculator surfaces still render correctly.

## Task interpretation {#task.classic-calculator-look.interpretation}

This is a UI-focused task rather than a logic change. The request is about appearance, layout, and interaction cues that evoke a classic desk calculator. It does not require changing calculation semantics.

## Relevant roles {#task.classic-calculator-look.roles}

- Designer or frontend developer: update the theme and layout.
- QA or reviewer: check the classic look across standard and scientific modes.

## Relevant components {#task.classic-calculator-look.components}

- `src/index.css` for shared colors, borders, shadows, and button styling.
- `src/components/Header.jsx` for branding and mode tabs.
- `src/components/Display.jsx` for the display panel and utility buttons.
- `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` for the main keypad buttons.
- `src/App.jsx` only if the task requires changing layout containers or introducing new state.

## Relevant domain models {#task.classic-calculator-look.domains}

- `domains/calculator-ui.md`

## Expected change flow {#task.classic-calculator-look.flow}

1. Adjust theme variables in `src/index.css` to match the desired classic calculator palette and spacing.
2. Review `Header`, `Display`, and the keypad components for any color or spacing mismatches.
3. Keep the existing `classic` theme entry point intact unless the task explicitly asks for a new theme.
4. Verify the app builds and that the display and keypad continue to render correctly.

## Contracts and invariants to preserve {#task.classic-calculator-look.invariants}

- The app should continue to support multiple calculator modes.
- The shared CSS variable approach should stay intact so styling changes remain centralized.
- The calculator logic and keyboard behavior should not change unless explicitly requested.

## Tests to add or update {#task.classic-calculator-look.tests}

No automated tests exist today. The minimum regression check is a manual review of standard and scientific views plus a production build.

## Commands to run {#task.classic-calculator-look.commands}

- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint` (expected to report existing lint issues)

## Risks and unknowns {#task.classic-calculator-look.risks}

- The classic look may require changes in multiple components because the theme is shared across the app.
- There is no visual regression suite today, so the task is more manual than automated.
- The exact visual target is not codified in the repository; the implementation will need to infer it from the request.

# WRK-1978 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The user is anyone using this app's Standard calculator mode as a browser-based calculator (`src/App.jsx`, `src/components/`). Today the Standard mode already uses a `classic` theme with shared CSS tokens (`src/index.css`), but it does not read as a physical desk-calculator: it lacks the raised/beveled button feel, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a cohesive muted classic color palette.

The problem is that the current visual presentation of Standard mode does not evoke a classic/desk calculator, which is the specific visual affinity the requester wants.

The measurable outcome: after the change, Standard mode's default theme presents raised/beveled keypad buttons, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a muted grey/beige classic color palette with simple borders/shadows — verifiable by visual review of the Standard mode screen, with `npm run build` still succeeding and no change to calculation behavior, keyboard shortcuts, or non-default themes.

## Proposed capability

Restyle the default/classic theme so the Standard calculator mode looks like a classic desk calculator, specifically:
- Raised/beveled, physical-style keypad buttons.
- A recessed LCD-style display panel for the expression/result area.
- A muted classic color palette (grey/beige tones) with simple borders and shadows, applied through the existing shared CSS variable/theme-token system rather than per-component hard-coded styles.

This is a visual/UX capability only — it does not change calculation logic, keyboard behavior, or the set of supported modes.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

**In scope:**
- The default/classic theme's visual tokens (`src/index.css`) and the Standard mode surfaces that consume them: the shell (`src/App.jsx`), header/mode tabs, the display panel, and the standard keypad (`src/components/Header.jsx`, `src/components/Display.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx`).

**Out of scope / exclusions:**
- No specific reference calculator model is being matched — this is a general retro/classic aesthetic, not a pixel-accurate skin of one device.
- Only the default/classic theme changes; other theme options (e.g. dark mode) are left as-is.
- Other modes (scientific, converter, financial, grapher) are not explicitly restyled component-by-component; they may passively inherit the shared CSS token changes, but no dedicated work is scoped for them in this change.
- No changes to calculation logic, expression evaluation (`src/utils/evaluator.js`), keyboard shortcuts, or history/memory behavior.

**Dependencies:**
- The existing shared CSS variable/theme-token system in `src/index.css`, which must remain centralized so the change doesn't require per-component styling.

**Constraints:**
- No automated visual regression suite exists; verification is manual review of the Standard mode plus a production build (`npm run build`). `npm run lint` is expected to still report its existing, pre-existing issues.
- Because the CSS token system is shared, changes must be reviewed for unintended spillover into other modes/themes even though they are not the explicit target.

**Stakeholders:**
- End users of the Standard calculator mode (primary beneficiaries of the visual change).
- Frontend developer/designer implementing the theme and layout updates.
- QA/reviewer confirming the classic look renders correctly in Standard mode without regressing other modes or themes.

**Assumptions confirmed with the requester:**
- "Classic" means a general retro/desk-calculator feel, not one specific model.
- Only the default theme changes.
- Standard mode is the primary, explicitly scoped target.
- The defining visual traits are: raised/beveled buttons, a recessed LCD-style display, and a muted classic color palette.

**Open questions:** none blocking — all material ambiguities were resolved in the recorded clarification checkpoint for this generation.

# WRK-1978 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The approved intake for this work item scoped the visual change as a generic "classic desk-calculator" restyle of Standard mode only, matching no specific reference model. During this phase's required human clarification checkpoint, the requester confirmed a different, more specific direction that supersedes that narrower framing: the app should be restyled to look like Microsoft's **Windows 11 Calculator** (Fluent Design), applied across the whole app rather than Standard mode alone. [WRK-1978:REQ-001]

The measurable outcome: the app's shell, display, and keypads across all existing modes adopt Windows 11 Calculator's Fluent Design language — rounded corners, acrylic/mica-style surfaces, modern accent colors, and Windows 11 typography/spacing/button-grid layout — in both light and dark themes, while every existing calculator mode, feature, and calculation behavior continues to work unchanged. [WRK-1978:REQ-002]

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Restyling to Windows 11 Fluent Design across all existing modes: Standard, Scientific, Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, and Function Grapher (`src/App.jsx`, `src/components/Header.jsx`, `src/components/Display.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx`, `src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx`, and other mode components under `src/components/`).
- A literal recreation of Windows 11 Calculator's layout, spacing, and button grid for Standard and Scientific modes, not just a color/typography-inspired reskin.
- Both light and dark theme variants matching Windows 11 Calculator's palettes, implemented through the shared CSS variable/theme-token system (`src/index.css`) rather than per-component hard-coded styles.
- Full responsiveness: the UI must remain usable at both desktop and mobile viewport widths.
- Preservation of all existing features: memory, history, sound feedback, keyboard shortcuts, and every current calculator mode.

**Out of scope / exclusions:**
- No changes to calculation semantics, expression evaluation, or formatting logic (`src/utils/evaluator.js`).
- No removal of modes/features that Windows 11 Calculator itself doesn't have (Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, Function Grapher remain — they are restyled with the same visual language rather than dropped).
- No specific commitment to pixel-perfect parity with Windows 11 Calculator for modes it doesn't include (Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, Function Grapher); those apply the same design tokens without a native reference to copy exactly.

**Supersession note:** This scope explicitly overrides the approved intake artifact's "general retro aesthetic, Standard mode only, no specific reference model" framing, per the requester's confirmation recorded in this generation's clarification checkpoint. [WRK-1978:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

- Standard and Scientific modes visually match Windows 11 Calculator's Fluent Design layout, button grid, spacing, and color system, in both light and dark themes. [WRK-1978:AC-001]
- Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, and Function Grapher modes are restyled using the same Windows 11 Fluent Design tokens (colors, shapes, typography, elevation) as Standard/Scientific, even though Windows 11 Calculator has no native screens for them. [WRK-1978:AC-002]
- All existing calculator modes remain reachable and functionally unchanged (arithmetic, scientific, unit conversion, financial, graphing); memory, history, sound, and keyboard shortcut behavior continue to work exactly as before. [WRK-1978:AC-003]
- The UI remains fully responsive and usable at both desktop and mobile viewport widths after the restyle. [WRK-1978:AC-004]
- `npm run build` succeeds after the change, with no change to calculation results or error states. [WRK-1978:AC-005]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

**Dependencies:**
- The shared CSS variable/theme-token system in `src/index.css` must be extended (or replaced) to carry Windows 11 Fluent tokens — colors, corner radii, elevation/acrylic effects — for both light and dark themes, so the change stays centralized rather than per-component.

**Risks:**
- Because styling is driven by shared tokens, changes can spill over unintentionally between modes/themes; this requires careful review across all five modes.
- No automated visual regression suite exists; verification is manual review of each mode/theme combination plus a successful `npm run build`. `npm run lint` is expected to still report its existing, pre-existing issues.
- Windows 11 Calculator has no native equivalent for Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, or Function Grapher screens, so applying the Fluent language there is a novel design exercise rather than a direct copy, which raises the risk of visual inconsistency across modes.

**Decisions confirmed via the required clarification checkpoint** (recorded in `singularity/work-items/WRK-1978/context/clarifications-requirements-gen1.json`):
- Target style: Windows 11 (Fluent Design), not Windows 10 or the classic/Windows 7 skeuomorphic style.
- Fidelity: literal recreation of Windows 11 Calculator's layout, spacing, and button grid — not merely an inspired color/typography pass.
- Feature scope: all existing modes and features are preserved and restyled; nothing is trimmed to match Windows 11 Calculator's narrower native feature set.
- Theming: both light and dark themes are required, matching Windows 11 Calculator's palettes.
- Responsiveness: full desktop and mobile support is required; this is not a desktop-only redesign.
- These decisions explicitly supersede the approved intake artifact's narrower "classic desk-calculator, Standard mode only, no specific reference model" framing, per the requester's explicit confirmation during this phase.

**Open questions:** none blocking — all material ambiguities for this generation were resolved in the recorded clarification checkpoint.

# WRK-1978 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The user is anyone using this app's Standard calculator mode as a browser-based calculator (`src/App.jsx`, `src/components/`). Today the Standard mode already uses a `classic` theme with shared CSS tokens (`src/index.css`), but it does not read as a physical desk-calculator: it lacks the raised/beveled button feel, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a cohesive muted classic color palette.

The problem is that the current visual presentation of Standard mode does not evoke a classic/desk calculator, which is the specific visual affinity the requester wants.

The measurable outcome: after the change, Standard mode's default theme presents raised/beveled keypad buttons, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a muted grey/beige classic color palette with simple borders/shadows — verifiable by visual review of the Standard mode screen, with `npm run build` still succeeding and no change to calculation behavior, keyboard shortcuts, or non-default themes.

## Proposed capability

Restyle the default/classic theme so the Standard calculator mode looks like a classic desk calculator, specifically:
- Raised/beveled, physical-style keypad buttons.
- A recessed LCD-style display panel for the expression/result area.
- A muted classic color palette (grey/beige tones) with simple borders and shadows, applied through the existing shared CSS variable/theme-token system rather than per-component hard-coded styles.

This is a visual/UX capability only — it does not change calculation logic, keyboard behavior, or the set of supported modes.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

**In scope:**
- The default/classic theme's visual tokens (`src/index.css`) and the Standard mode surfaces that consume them: the shell (`src/App.jsx`), header/mode tabs, the display panel, and the standard keypad (`src/components/Header.jsx`, `src/components/Display.jsx

# WRK-1978 — Feature Requirements

## Problem and outcome

The approved intake for this work item scoped the visual change as a generic "classic desk-calculator" restyle of Standard mode only, matching no specific reference model. During this phase's required human clarification checkpoint, the requester confirmed a different, more specific direction that supersedes that narrower framing: the app should be restyled to look like Microsoft's **Windows 11 Calculator** (Fluent Design), applied across the whole app rather than Standard mode alone. [WRK-1978:REQ-001]

The measurable outcome: the app's shell, display, and keypads across all existing modes adopt Windows 11 Calculator's Fluent Design language — rounded corners, acrylic/mica-style surfaces, modern accent colors, and Windows 11 typography/spacing/button-grid layout — in both light and dark themes, while every existing calculator mode, feature, and calculation behavior continues to work unchanged. [WRK-1978:REQ-002]

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Restyling to Windows 11 Fluent Design across all existing modes: Standard, Scientific, Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, and Function Grapher (`src/App.jsx`, `src/components/Header.jsx`, `src/components/Display.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx`, `src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx`, and other mode components under `src/components/`).
- A literal recreation of Windows 11 Calculator's layout, spacing, and button grid for Standard and Scientific modes, not just a color/typography-inspired reskin.
- Both light and dark theme variants matching Windows 11 Calculator's palettes, implemented through the shared CSS variable/theme-token system (`src/index.css`) rather than per-component hard-coded styles.
- Full responsiveness: the UI must remain usable at both desktop and mobile viewport widths.
- Preservation of all existing features: memory, history, sound feedback, keyboard shortcuts, and every current calculator mode.

**Out of scope / exclusions:**
- No changes to calculation semantics, expression evaluation, or formatting logic (`src/utils/evaluator.js`).
- No removal of modes/features that Windows 11 Calculator itself doesn't have (Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, Function Grapher remain — they are restyled with the same visual language rather than dropped).
- No specific commitment to pixel-perfect parity with Windows 11 Calculator for modes it doesn't include (Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, Function Grapher); those apply the same design tokens without a native reference to copy exactly.

**Supersession note:** This scope explicitly overrides the approved intake artifact's "general retro aesthetic, Standard mode only, no specific reference model" framing, per the requester's confirmation recorded in this generation's clarification checkpoint. [WRK-1978:CON-001]

## Acceptance criteria

- Standard and Scientific modes visually match Windows 11 Calculator's Fluent Design layout, button grid, spacing, and color system, in both light and dark themes. [WRK-1978:AC-001]
- Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, and Function Grapher modes are restyled using the same Windows 11 Fluent Design tokens (colors, shapes, typography, elevation) as Standard/Scientific, even though Windows 11 Calculator has no native screens for them. [WRK-1978:AC-002]
- All existing calculator modes remain reachable and functionally unchanged (arithmetic, scientific, unit conversion, financial, graphing); memory, history, sound, and keyboard shortcut behavior continue to work exactly as before. [WRK-1978:AC-003]
- The UI remains fully responsive and usable at both desktop and mobile viewport widths after the restyle. [WRK-1978:AC-004]
- `npm run build` succeeds after the change, with no change to calculation results or error states. [WRK-1978:AC-005]

## Dependencies, risks, and open questions

**Dependencies:**
- The shared CSS variable/theme-token system in `src/index.css` must be extended (or replaced) to carry Windows 11 Fluent tokens — colors, corner radii, elevation/acrylic effects — for both light and dark themes, so the change stays centralized rather than per-component.

**Risks:**
- Because styling is driven by shared tokens, changes can spill over unintentionally between modes/themes; this requires careful review across all five modes.
- No automated visual regression suite exists; verification is manual review of each mode/theme combination plus a successful `npm run build`. `npm run lint` is expected to still report its existing, pre-existing issues.
- Windows 11 Calculator has no native equivalent for Unit Converter, Financial Calculator, or Function Grapher screens, so applying the Fluent language there is a novel design exercise rather than a direct copy, which raises the risk of visual inconsistency across modes.

**Decisions confirmed via the required clarification checkpoint** (recorded in `singularity/work-items/WRK-1978/context/clarifications-requirements-gen1.json`):
- Target style: Windows 11 (Fluent Design), not Windows 10 or the classic/Windows 7 skeuomorphic style.
- Fidelity: literal recreation of Windows 11 Calculator's layout, spacing, and button grid — not merely an inspired color/typography pass.
- Feature scope: all existing modes and features are preserved and restyled; nothing is trimmed to match Windows 11 Calculator's narrower native feature set.
- Theming: both light and dark themes are required, matching Windows 11 Calculator's palettes.
- Responsiveness: full desktop and mobile support is required; this is not a desktop-only redesign.
- These decisions explicitly supersede the approved intake artifact's narrower "classic desk-calculator, Standard mode only, no specific reference model" framing, per the requester's explicit confirmation during this phase.

**Open questions:** none blocking — all material ambiguities for this generation were resolved in the recorded clarification checkpoint.

# WRK-1978 — Feature Intake

## User and outcome

The user is anyone using this app's Standard calculator mode as a browser-based calculator (`src/App.jsx`, `src/components/`). Today the Standard mode already uses a `classic` theme with shared CSS tokens (`src/index.css`), but it does not read as a physical desk-calculator: it lacks the raised/beveled button feel, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a cohesive muted classic color palette.

The problem is that the current visual presentation of Standard mode does not evoke a classic/desk calculator, which is the specific visual affinity the requester wants.

The measurable outcome: after the change, Standard mode's default theme presents raised/beveled keypad buttons, a recessed LCD-style display panel, and a muted grey/beige classic color palette with simple borders/shadows — verifiable by visual review of the Standard mode screen, with `npm run build` still succeeding and no change to calculation behavior, keyboard shortcuts, or non-default themes.

## Proposed capability

Restyle the default/classic theme so the Standard calculator mode looks like a classic desk calculator, specifically:
- Raised/beveled, physical-style keypad buttons.
- A recessed LCD-style display panel for the expression/result area.
- A muted classic color palette (grey/beige tones) with simple borders and shadows, applied through the existing shared CSS variable/theme-token system rather than per-component hard-coded styles.

This is a visual/UX capability only — it does not change calculation logic, keyboard behavior, or the set of supported modes.

## Scope, constraints, and stakeholders

**In scope:**
- The default/classic theme's visual tokens (`src/index.css`) and the Standard mode surfaces that consume them: the shell (`src/App.jsx`), header/mode tabs, the display panel, and the standard keypad (`src/components/Header.jsx`, `src/components/Display.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx`).

**Out of scope / exclusions:**
- No specific reference calculator model is being matched — this is a general retro/classic aesthetic, not a pixel-accurate skin of one device.
- Only the default/classic theme changes; other theme options (e.g. dark mode) are left as-is.
- Other modes (scientific, converter, financial, grapher) are not explicitly restyled component-by-component; they may passively inherit the shared CSS token changes, but no dedicated work is scoped for them in this change.
- No changes to calculation logic, expression evaluation (`src/utils/evaluator.js`), keyboard shortcuts, or history/memory behavior.

**Dependencies:**
- The existing shared CSS variable/theme-token system in `src/index.css`, which must remain centralized so the change doesn't require per-component styling.

**Constraints:**
- No automated visual regression suite exists; verification is manual review of the Standard mode plus a production build (`npm run build`). `npm run lint` is expected to still report its existing, pre-existing issues.
- Because the CSS token system is shared, changes must be reviewed for unintended spillover into other modes/themes even though they are not the explicit target.

**Stakeholders:**
- End users of the Standard calculator mode (primary beneficiaries of the visual change).
- Frontend developer/designer implementing the theme and layout updates.
- QA/reviewer confirming the classic look renders correctly in Standard mode without regressing other modes or themes.

**Assumptions confirmed with the requester:**
- "Classic" means a general retro/desk-calculator feel, not one specific model.
- Only the default theme changes.
- Standard mode is the primary, explicitly scoped target.
- The defining visual traits are: raised/beveled buttons, a recessed LCD-style display, and a muted classic color palette.

**Open questions:** none blocking — all material ambiguities were resolved in the recorded clarification checkpoint for this generation.
