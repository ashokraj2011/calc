## Summary from “Agent brief”

<!--
Summarize the approved intent for downstream agents in a compact, standalone form. Include the
problem, intended outcome, principal actors, most important scenarios, hard constraints, and major
exclusions. Do not introduce claims that are absent from the sections below. Exact requirements and
boundary conditions are preserved separately by the governed projection.

The calculator will add a CFA Level I study toolkit to the existing browser calculator. A learner
can select a Level I topic, enter the inputs for a supported calculation, and receive a clearly
formatted result with the formula context needed to check their work. The first release covers
Quantitative Methods, Economics, Financial Statement Analysis, Corporate Issuers, Equity, Fixed
Income, Derivatives, Alternative Investments, and Portfolio Management. It remains client-side,
uses the existing calculator visual language, and excludes authenticated learning content,
question-bank delivery, and server-backed progress tracking.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- **SPEC-001** — The app must provide a CFA Level I toolkit entry point using the existing
  calculator navigation and visual language. *(S1, S3)*
- **AC-001** — A learner can reach the toolkit from the app, and the completed flow uses the
  existing calculator layout without a separate authenticated surface. *(S1, S3)*
- **SPEC-002** — The toolkit must expose the nine Level I topic areas named in the boundary
  conditions. *(S1)*
- **AC-002** — A topic selector or equivalent visible navigation presents all nine named topics and
  allows the learner to select one. *(S1)*
- **SPEC-003** — Every released calculation must declare its required inputs, calculate from the
  current input values, and display the calculation name and result together. *(S1)*
- **AC-003** — For each released calculation, valid inputs produce a visible result that reflects
  the current values and identifies the calculation used. *(S1)*
- **SPEC-004** — The toolkit must validate empty, malformed, non-finite, and out-of-domain inputs
  before displaying a numeric result. *(S2)*
- **AC-004** — Invalid or incomplete input produces actionable guidance, preserves correction-ready
  values, and displays no numeric result. *(S2)*
- **SPEC-005** — Changing or clearing an input must invalidate or recalculate the displayed result
  so that it never represents superseded values. *(S1, S2)*
- **AC-005** — After an input change or clear action, the visible result is recalculated from the
  new values or removed. *(S1, S2)*
- **SPEC-006** — The completed user flow must show the selected topic, relevant inputs, and result
  in a screenshot using the existing app style. *(S3)*
- **AC-006** — Acceptance evidence includes a screenshot containing the selected Level I topic,
  entered inputs, and resulting value in the completed flow. *(S3)*

## Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-001 — Responsiveness:** For a valid local calculation, the result must appear within 250 ms
  of the calculation action in a production build, measured with browser performance timestamps
  across 20 consecutive runs on the supported development machine.
- **NFR-002 — Accessibility:** Topic controls, inputs, validation messages, and results must be
  keyboard reachable and have accessible names; verify with the existing automated UI test setup
  and an accessibility-tree inspection of the completed flow.
- **NFR-003 — Privacy:** Inputs and results must remain client-side and must not be sent to a
  network endpoint; verify with a browser network inspection during the completed flow.
- **NFR-004 — Layout:** The completed flow must render without horizontal overflow at the supported
  mobile and desktop viewport sizes; verify with responsive browser screenshots.

## Boundary conditions

- The first release must expose exactly these nine topic areas: Quantitative Methods, Economics,
  Financial Statement Analysis, Corporate Issuers, Equity, Fixed Income, Derivatives, Alternative
  Investments, and Portfolio Management.
- Each calculation must declare its required inputs and valid domain before calculation. Empty,
  malformed, non-finite, or out-of-domain values must be rejected with an actionable message.
- Results are browser-local and do not require a backend, account, or network request.
- The user flow must remain usable in the existing responsive calculator layout; no new flow may
  require horizontal scrolling at the app's supported mobile breakpoint.
- A calculation must not replace a valid result with a stale value after an input changes or is
  cleared.
